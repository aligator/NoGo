// Package nogo implements gitignore parsing in pure go.
// It supports the official specification. https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore/2.34.0
//
//  PATTERN FORMAT
//
//    * A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.
//
//    * A line starting with # serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("\") in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.
//
//    * Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash ("\").
//
//    * An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become included again. It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded. Git doesnâ€™t list excluded directories for performance reasons, so any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are defined. Put a backslash ("\") in front of the first "!" for patterns that begin with a literal "!", for example, "\!important!.txt".
//
//    * The slash / is used as the directory separator. Separators may occur at the beginning, middle or end of the .gitignore search pattern.
//
//    * If there is a separator at the beginning or middle (or both) of the pattern, then the pattern is relative to the directory level of the particular .gitignore file itself. Otherwise the pattern may also matches at any level below the .gitignore level.
//
//    * If there is a separator at the end of the pattern then the pattern will only matches directories, otherwise the pattern can matches both files and directories.
//      For example, a pattern doc/frotz/ matches doc/frotz directory, but not a/doc/frotz directory; however frotz/ matches frotz and a/frotz that is a directory (all paths are relative from the .gitignore file).
//
//    * An asterisk "*" matches anything except a slash. The character "?" matches any one character except "/". The range notation, e.g. [a-zA-Z], can be used to matches one of the characters in a range. See fnmatch(3) and the FNM_PATHNAME flag for a more detailed description.
//
//  Two consecutive asterisks ("**") in patterns matched against full pathname may have special meaning:
//
//    * A leading "**" followed by a slash means matches in all directories. For example, "**/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere, the same as pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory "bar" anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".
//
//    * A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**" matches all files inside directory "abc", relative to the location of the .gitignore file, with infinite depth.
//
//    * A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b", "a/x/y/b" and so on.
//
//    * Other consecutive asterisks are considered regular asterisks and will matches according to the previous rules.

// You can use this if you know that no file gets checked without also

//
// As the parent-check is time-consuming it is for example better to disable
// that check when using Walk function.
// (NoGo.WalkDirFunc and NoGo.WalkAferoFunc use it for example).
//
// Example:
//  Folder1
//   - File1
//  .gitignore -> Rule: "/Folder1"
//
// If the gitignore contains the rule "/Folder1" and you check the file
// `/Folder1/File1`, you will get a correct match.
//
// But if you check the file WITH "WithoutMatchParents", the file will not match
// as it itself is not in any ignore-list and the parent folder does not get checked.
//
// When doing file traversal with a Walk method, this doesn't matter
// as the Folder1 won't be read and therefore /Folder1/File1 won't be read either.
